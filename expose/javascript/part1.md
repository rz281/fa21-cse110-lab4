question 1: values added: 20
question 2: final result: 20
question 3: values added: 20 
question 4: An error would occur as the variable result does not exist outside the if block because of scope
question 5: An error would occur as you are trying to change the value of a const, which is not allowed
question 6: An error would occur as the variable result does not exist outside the if block because of scope
PART 2: 
question 1: 3
question 2: 150
question 3: 150
question 4: [50, 100, 150] it will return this because discount is an array holding all discountPrices because all the final
	    prices were pushed into the array discount
question 5: Will return an error, because i is only in the scope of the for loop and the console log is outside of the loop
question 6: Will return an error, because discountPrice is only in the scope of the for loop
question 7: 150
question 8: [50, 100, 150] since values are pushed into the array in the for loop, and the array is returned in the same scope
	    as where the array discounted was declared, the return does not throw an error
question 9: An error will occur, i is not in the same scope as where the console call is, only exists in for loop
question 10: 3
question 11: [50, 100, 150] values are being pushed into slots of the array but the variable discounted is not being modified
